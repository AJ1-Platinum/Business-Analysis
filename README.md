## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes restaurant ratings based on customer preferences and reviews. The goal is to identify investment opportunities by evaluating the demand-supply gaps, customer satisfaction trends, and the cuisines with the highest potential for success.

---

## 📊 Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from customer preferences and restaurant reviews. It includes:
- Customer cuisine preferences
- Restaurant offerings
- Rating scores (Food, Service, and Overall Ratings)
- Restaurant locations
- Demand and supply insights

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For visualization and dashboard creation
- **Power Query**: Data preprocessing and cleaning
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Advanced calculations
- **SQL**: For structured data querying and filtering

---

## 🔍 Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:
1. Removed duplicate and irrelevant data
2. Handled missing values in rating columns by removing entirely or replacing with average values.
3. Standardized cuisine categories and created a table showing unique cuisines.
4. Created calculated columns using DAX.
5. Merged multiple datasets to form a unified data model.
6. Created relationships among tables in PowerBI.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analyses conducted include:
- Identification of popular cuisines based on customer preferences.
- Evaluation of supply gaps by comparing customer demand to restaurant offerings.
- Analysis of restaurant ratings to determine quality trends.
- Calculated an **Investment Score** to identify cuisines with high demand but low supply, thereby identifying best investment opportunities.

---

## 📊 Data Analysis
### Key Metrics & Insights:
- **Top-rated Cuisines**: Identified cuisines with consistently high ratings.
- **Unmet Demand**: Cuisines with high customer preference but little to no restaurant to met such preferences. 
- **Investment Score**: A calculated metric to highlight the most profitable cuisine to invest in.
- **Consumer Demographics**: Ananlysis of distribution of consumers by age, location, budget, marital status and occupation to determine if there are biases in the ratings.

## 📌 Results & Findings
- The analysis revealed that **Mexican cuisine** has the highest investment potential due to strong demand but limited supply.
- The **average restaurant rating** was found to be relatively low, indicating potential for improvement.
- **Service ratings were a key determinant** of overall customer satisfaction.
- Several **cuisines lacked restaurant representation**, making them lucrative investment opportunities.
- Findings from **Consumer Demograpics** suggests a bias in ratings.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Expand Mexican Cuisine Offerings**: Increase restaurant supply to meet demand.
2. **Improve Service Quality**: Since service ratings strongly impact customer perception.
3. **Target Underserved Cuisines**: Invest in cuisines with high unmet demand.
4. **Enhance Customer Engagement**: Leverage reviews and feedback for continuous improvement.
5. **Optimize Restaurant Locations**: Establish new restaurants in areas with strong demand but low supply.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- The dataset may not reflect the most recent customer trends.
- Ratings are subjective and can be influenced by various factors.
- Demand estimates are based on preferences, not actual purchase behavior.
